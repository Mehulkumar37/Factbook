                <h1>Fact: The Pacific Ring of Fire is a horseshoe-shaped area around the edges of the Pacific Ocean where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.</h1>
                <p class="fact-text">It is home to approximately 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes and experiences about 90% of the world's earthquakes. The Ring of Fire is the result of tectonic plate movements, where the Pacific Plate collides with and is subducted beneath other plates, leading to seismic activity and volcanic eruptions. This region is highly significant for its geological activity, shaping landscapes and impacting human settlements along its perimeter. The Ring of Fire is closely monitored by scientists for its potential to generate tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions that can have devastating consequences for nearby communities and ecosystems.</p>

                <h1>Fact: The Sahara Desert was not always a desert; it experienced periods of lush vegetation and even hosted ancient civilizations.</h1>
                <p class="fact-text">Geological evidence suggests that the Sahara was once a fertile region with rivers, lakes, and grasslands, but changes in the Earth's orbit and axial tilt led to climate shifts, causing the area to become increasingly arid over time. Archaeological sites such as the Egyptian pyramids and rock art in the Sahara testify to its rich human history. The transformation of the Sahara highlights the dynamic nature of Earth's climate and the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems and civilizations. Today, the Sahara is undergoing further changes due to factors such as desertification, climate change, and human activities, posing challenges for the people and wildlife that call this vast desert home.</p>
