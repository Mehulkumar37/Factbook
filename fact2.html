                <p class="fact-text">Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. The unique chemical composition of honey, with its low moisture content and acidic pH, creates an environment that prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi.</p>

                <p class="fact-text">While both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans contain high levels of salt, the Atlantic Ocean is generally saltier than the Pacific Ocean. This difference in salinity is due to factors such as evaporation rates, precipitation patterns, and the circulation of ocean currents, creating distinct marine ecosystems and habitats.</p>

                <p class="fact-text">Bees possess a sophisticated form of communication known as the waggle dance. By performing specific movements and patterns, bees can convey information about the direction, distance, and quality of food sources to their hive mates. This dance language helps coordinate collective foraging efforts within the colony.</p>

With an average annual precipitation of only about 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters), the vast majority of Antarctica is technically classified as a desert. Its cold temperatures cause most of the precipitation to fall as snow, creating the world's largest ice sheet.</p>
